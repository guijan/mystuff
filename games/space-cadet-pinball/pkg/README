To play SpaceCadetPinball, you need the original game data from
3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet. The game was included with
Microsoft Windows versions 95 through XP.

It's possible to extract the data from a Microsoft Windows XP install CD
by following the steps below:

1. Mount the Windows XP CD (assumed to be on /dev/cd0a).
# mount /dev/cd0a /mnt

2. Install archivers/cabextract.
# pkg_add cabextract

3. Extract the game files.
# cabextract -d /usr/local/share/SpaceCadetPinball \
    /mnt/I386/{FONT.da_,PINBALL.*,SOUND*.*,TABLE.BM_}

4. Uppercase the game files.
# for file in ${LOCALBASE}/share/SpaceCadetPinball/*; \
    do out="$(printf '%s' "${file##*/}" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z')"; \
    mv "$file" ${LOCALBASE}/share/SpaceCadetPinball/"$out"; done
